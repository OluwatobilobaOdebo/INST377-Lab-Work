        <h1> Oluwatobiloba Odebo Lab 1: Intro to HTML </h1>

        <h2> First, the basics. </h2>

        <p> You need the following to build your website: </p>

        <ul>   
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li> 
            <li>Node.js</li>
        </ul>

        <p> As a short diversion, here is a list describing my top 5 favorite albums!: </p>

        <ol>
            <li> Views </li>
            <li> If Your're Reading This It's Too Late </li>
            <li> What a Time To Be Alive </li>
            <li> More Life </li>
            <li> Certified Lover Boy </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2> Let's Try Some Inline Elements </h2>

        <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>

Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.

Sometimes you want to do both.

Empty Elements

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

Images 

Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.

Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for class.
If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."
